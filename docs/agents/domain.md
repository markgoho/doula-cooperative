# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout

This is a multi-context repo. Read `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root first, then read the context file relevant to the task:

- `functions/CONTEXT.md` — Firebase Functions APIs for the members app and public forms.
- `members/CONTEXT.md` — Angular members app.
- `hugo/CONTEXT.md` — Hugo static website.

Also read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in:

- `docs/adr/` — system-wide decisions.
- `<context>/docs/adr/` — context-specific decisions, if present.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in the relevant `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
